# Beat the Streak with Machine Learning

To see the results of this project, visit the [project website](rohannarain.github.io/beat_the_streak). 

## What is this?
In short, this project involves using several machine learning models (Random Forests, AdaBoost, and Logistic Regression specifically) to play Major League Baseball's Beat The Streak contest. The idea is simple: every day, you decide which player you think is most likely to get a hit on that given day, and you enter that pick into the app. The goal is to get a streak going--if you pick 56 players in a row correctly, you'll win a lot of money.

## How does it work?
I have a [blog post](https://decisionsandvisions.wordpress.com/2019/08/21/playing-beat-the-streak-using-machine-learning/) written about this project--it includes analysis of the models I used and some insight into how I went about retrieving the data. Feel free to check it out!

## What do I do with the table on the home page of the website?
The table displays the top 10 most likely players to get a hit today, based on the probabilities outputted by whichever algorithm performed best on a validation set (more details in aforementioned blog post). It's up to you to use whatever context you feel is necessary (opposing team, ballpark, etc.) in addition to this table to make sure your picks are intelligent and informed.

## Who made this?
My name is Rohan Narain, and I'm a fourth-year student at UC Berkeley studying Statistics and Data Science. I'm an avid baseball fan, and one of the things I love most about the sport is the statistics. I've been experimenting with baseball analytics for a while now, and this is my biggest project to date.
